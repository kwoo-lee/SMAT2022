The repository contains a simulation dataset, SMAT2022. [(Kopp et al, 2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9115710) propose a new dataset SMT2020 containing characteristics of modern FAB, it is an additional version including AMHS (Automated Material Handling System). We tried to reflect the details of AMHS in modern FAB.

### Description

---

- As Kopp suggested, This dataset includes four models (HVLM, LVHM, HVLM_E, LVHM_E) with AMHS attributes. Each model is provided in Excel file format (XLSX). We provide the original version of the SMT2020 dataset in a folder named ‘SMT2020’ (or you can access it at [https://p2schedgen.fernuni-hagen.de/index.php/downloads/simulation](https://p2schedgen.fernuni-hagen.de/index.php/downloads/simulation)).
- There are eight additional sheets to describe AMHS in modern fabs as follows:
    - Address
    - Rail
    - Bay
    - Equipment
    - PortType
    - Port
    - VehicleType
    - Vehicle
    - ZCU
- Additional specifications about the above sheets are suggested in the file named ‘SMAT_2022_generic_format’.
- Finally, We would like to share a simple simulator that can open these simulation model files. This simulator is a demo version of PINOKIO, Carlo. It is possible to use the simulator by installing ‘Pinokio_Demo.exe’. It only works in Windows environments. For detailed usage, refer to the file ‘PinokioGuide’.
